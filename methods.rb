#### Question 1
# Write a method called square
# that takes one argument and
# returns that argument multiplied it by itself

#### Question 2
# Write a method called greet
# that takes one argument, with a default value of the string 'world'
# and returns the string of 'hello ' and the value of the argument
# For example:
# greet() #=> 'hello world'
# greet('David') #=> 'hello David'

#### Question 3
# Write a method call repeat_string
# that accepts a string and an optional multiplier (defaults to 3)
# and returns the original string repeated that many times (using the * operator).
# Do not use an options hash or keyword arguments.
# For example:
# repeat_string('whoa ') #=> 'whoa whoa whoa '
# repeat_string('wat', 2) #=> 'watwat'

#### Question 4
# Write a method called blackjack?
# that takes one or more arguments that represent cards
# that will be FixNum of 2..10 or Symbols of :jack, :queen, :king, :ace
# and returns if the sum of the value of the cards is 21 (a blackjack)
# :jack, :queen and :king have a value of 10
# :ace has a value of 1 or 11, and is whichever is more advantagous to making a blackjack? true
# For example:
# blackjack?(2, 10) #=> false
# blackjack?(:ace, 10) #=> true
# blackjack?(5, 10, 6) #=> true
# blackjack?(:ace, :ace, 2, 7) #=> true
